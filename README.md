#CELSIUS/FAHRENHEIT CONVERTER
-----------------------------
This is a personal project to practice user inputs with node.js. I learnt how to use process.argv[] a bit better, which was really satisfying. Not too much of a challenge, though there were some road bumps figuring process.argv better. As always, any feedback is more than welcome. Thanks!
